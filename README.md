### Unending MUD Engine

Welcome to my personal foray into building a MUD game engine.
The purpose of this project is to try out some concepts, that have been on my
mind for a while. As well as to play around with some new technologies.

- SBT project
- Made in Intellij with Scala and HOCON plugins.
